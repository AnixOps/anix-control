# Upgrade Runbook

This runbook covers operator upgrades for AnixOps Control releases. Release
artifacts must come from GitHub Actions. Do not build binaries, frontend assets,
Docker metadata, checksums, SBOMs, or release manifests on the production host.

Use this together with:

- [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [`manual-intervention.md`](manual-intervention.md)
- [`features.md`](features.md)
- [`reference/sqlite-to-postgres-migration.md`](reference/sqlite-to-postgres-migration.md)

## Scope

Use this runbook when moving a running panel from one GitHub Release tag to
another. It applies to systemd binary deployments and Docker-based deployments.

Do not use it for:

- first-time installation
- SQLite to PostgreSQL migration without the dedicated migration runbook
- emergency data repair
- payment credential changes
- domain, TLS, or reverse-proxy ownership changes

Those operations require their own operator approval and rollback plan.

## Fixed Legacy Native Layout

For the specific legacy layout discovered on the old native host
(`/usr/local/v2board/v2board`, `/etc/v2board/config.yaml`, and
`/var/lib/v2board/frontend`), the repository includes
[`scripts/upgrade_legacy_panel_v2.5.0.sh`](../scripts/upgrade_legacy_panel_v2.5.0.sh).
It is an opt-in, root-only helper for a PostgreSQL database named `v2board`; it
backs up the database and runtime files, verifies release checksums, performs
an `/health` check, and writes a rollback script. Do not use it for Docker,
SQLite, foreign V2Board/XBoard schemas, or installations with different paths.
Run the general artifact and migration checks in this document first, and set
`VERSION` explicitly when upgrading to a different release tag.

## Pre-Upgrade Checklist

Before touching production:

- Confirm the target GitHub Release tag and current production version.
- Read the release notes and `CHANGELOG.md` entries for the target version.
- Check [`docs/features.md`](features.md) for partial/planned features and
  compatibility surfaces.
- Confirm the maintenance window and rollback owner.
- Back up the database and active config.
- If the release mentions schema or data changes, record the migration dry-run
  evidence attached to the GitHub Release.
- Verify the deployment type: systemd binary, Docker Compose, or another
  operator-managed wrapper.

Evidence to keep:

- current service version or commit
- target tag
- downloaded artifact names
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` verification output
- `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json` summary
- database/config backup paths and checksums
- `/health` output before and after upgrade
- rollback decision

## Artifact Verification

Download artifacts from the GitHub Release for the target tag. At minimum,
download:

- the matching `anix-control-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` backend artifact (or the
  matching Windows `.exe.zip`)
- `anix-control-frontend.tar.gz` or `anix-control-frontend.zip`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json`
- `OPERATOR_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `RELEASE_NOTES.md`
- `verify-machine-telemetry-signature.py`
- `migration-dry-run.txt`
- `anix-control-source.sbom.spdx.json`

The formal `v4.0.0` release attaches all sixteen signed official package
artifacts. The package set is fixed by the V4 evidence bundle; do not import a
partial or mixed-version cohort. For each package ID, keep these files from the
same release together:

- `<plugin-id>-4.0.0.anxp`
- `<plugin-id>-4.0.0.manifest.json`
- `<plugin-id>-4.0.0.manifest.sig`
- `<plugin-id>-4.0.0.public-key.pem`
- `<plugin-id>-4.0.0.sbom.spdx.json`

The release-level `official-public-key.raw`, `v4-release-evidence.tar.gz`, and
`SHA256SUMS.txt` bind the entire cohort. Historical `v4.0.0-alpha.*` assets
remain frozen preview evidence and must not be mixed into the formal bundle.

Verify checksums before replacing any production file:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt
```

Open `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json` and confirm:

- `build_source` is `github-actions`
- `manual_deployment_required` is `true`
- `commit` and `tag` match the intended release
- every artifact you will deploy appears with the expected size and SHA-256

If the manifest or checksum verification fails, stop the upgrade.

Verify a package manifest signature with the public key published by the same
GitHub Release, or with the pinned AnixOps trust root already approved in your
environment:

```bash
python3 verify-machine-telemetry-signature.py \
  --manifest machine-telemetry-4.0.0.manifest.json \
  --artifact machine-telemetry-4.0.0.anxp \
  --signature machine-telemetry-4.0.0.manifest.sig \
  --public-key machine-telemetry-4.0.0.public-key.pem
```

If the package hash, manifest signature, or trust-root fingerprint does not
match the release record, stop before enabling any plugin flag.

## Plugin-Only Bootstrap And Execution

`v4.0.0` is the formal plugin-only Control release. A new database must import
the signed `identity-platform` package before it can serve authenticated
Control routes. The release installer downloads the three identity assets,
verifies each against the release `SHA256SUMS.txt`, stores them under
`/opt/anixops/control/bootstrap/identity-platform-<version>` as root-owned,
group-readable files, sets the bootstrap directory and enables only Control
package execution. It also creates service-user-private `runtime/plugin-hosts`
and `data/plugin-artifacts` directories under the selected installation root,
then verifies `/health`, the package gateway, and the initial administrator
login before reporting a fresh installation as successful.

For a manual deployment, verify the formal evidence bundle first, then place
exactly `identity-platform-4.0.0.anxp`,
`identity-platform-4.0.0.manifest.json`, and
`identity-platform-4.0.0.manifest.sig` in a root-owned directory with mode
`0750` and files mode `0640`, readable by the Control service group. Configure
that absolute path before the first Control start:

```yaml
plugins:
  identity_bootstrap_package_dir: "/var/lib/anixops/bootstrap"
  control_execution_enabled: true
  control_host_runtime_dir: "/opt/anixops/control/runtime/plugin-hosts"
  control_host_artifact_dir: "/opt/anixops/control/data/plugin-artifacts"
  dispatch_enabled: true
  topology_execution_enabled: false
```

The bootstrap import accepts only one V2 Control-target identity package signed
by the configured official root; it is idempotent and never replaces an
operator-selected non-empty bootstrap path. The installer preserves every
other existing configuration value, except that plugin runtime paths are set
under the installation root so they remain writable inside the systemd service
sandbox. Enablement order still matters:
`topology_execution_enabled=true` is refused unless `dispatch_enabled=true`.
Do not enable traffic or topology changes until the package artifact,
signature, migration evidence, node rollback plan, and canary cohort are
recorded. V4 retains route semantics through capability-scoped,
kernel-owned compatibility bridge operations, but an uninstalled, disabled,
unhealthy, unsigned, or incompatible package still returns a package-unavailable
response instead of falling back to direct HTTP handling.

`gost-mesh` v1 is canary-only. Its signed package embeds the exact GOST v3.2.6
runtime and supports QUIC and WSS, not TUIC. Both transports require mutual
TLS. An entry must verify the exit CA/server name and present a client
certificate; an exit must present its server certificate and trust only the
configured client CA. Enabled health probes require a source address covered by
the entry source-policy CIDRs so the probe follows the same route as business
traffic.

Before applying a `gost-mesh` configuration, verify the participating Linux
host has forwarding enabled and strict reverse-path filtering disabled:

```bash
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
sysctl -a 2>/dev/null | grep '^net.ipv4.conf.*.rp_filter ='
```

The required values are `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` and
`net.ipv4.conf.*.rp_filter=0` for all participating scopes/interfaces. The
plugin validates these prerequisites and fails closed; it does not change
host-wide sysctls. Current TLS configuration refers to private files already
materialized on the Agent. Control Secret ID to private-file materialization,
renewal, deletion, and audit are not complete, so a stable or production
`gost-mesh` rollout is prohibited even when package signature checks pass.

## Systemd Binary Upgrade

The exact service name and paths are operator-owned. The example below uses the
current installer defaults:

- service: `anix-control.service`
- binary path: `/opt/anixops/control/bin/anix-control`
- frontend path: `/opt/anixops/control/web/public`
- config path: `/opt/anixops/control/config/config.yaml`

Prepare backups:

```bash
sudo install -d -m 0750 /opt/anixops/control/backups
sudo cp -a /opt/anixops/control/bin/anix-control /opt/anixops/control/backups/anix-control.$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
sudo cp -a /opt/anixops/control/web/public /opt/anixops/control/backups/public.$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
sudo cp -a /opt/anixops/control/config/config.yaml /opt/anixops/control/backups/config.$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).yaml
```

Stop, replace, and start:

```bash
tar -xzf ./anix-control-linux-amd64.tar.gz

sudo systemctl stop anix-control.service

sudo install -m 0755 ./anix-control-linux-amd64 /opt/anixops/control/bin/anix-control
sudo rm -rf /opt/anixops/control/web/public.new
sudo mkdir -p /opt/anixops/control/web/public.new
sudo tar -xzf ./anix-control-frontend.tar.gz -C /opt/anixops/control/web/public.new
sudo rm -rf /opt/anixops/control/web/public
sudo mv /opt/anixops/control/web/public.new /opt/anixops/control/web/public

sudo systemctl start anix-control.service
sudo systemctl status anix-control.service --no-pager
```

Verify:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
sudo journalctl -u anix-control.service -n 120 --no-pager
```

Then check:

- login
- admin dashboard
- users, plans, nodes, orders, and payments
- subscription download route
- traffic hourly/ranking pages
- forwarding pages if enabled
- node heartbeat and UniProxy config pull

## Docker Compose Upgrade

Docker deployments must still use GitHub Release evidence. Do not build release
images or frontend assets from the production checkout.

Before upgrade:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs --tail=120
```

Verify the release's Docker metadata and digest in `docker-image.txt` if the
release includes one. Pull the approved image or deploy the approved binary and
frontend artifacts into the image strategy used by the operator. Then restart:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
```

Verify:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs --tail=120
```

If the deployment still requires a local Docker build, it is not a release
deployment under the current policy. Record it as a manual exception before
proceeding.

## Database And Migration Notes

For ordinary patch upgrades, keep the existing database driver and config.

If a release requires schema/data changes:

- review release notes before the maintenance window
- keep `migration-dry-run.txt` from the GitHub Release
- record pre/post row counts for affected tables
- keep rollback instructions for each changed schema helper
- do not combine SQLite-to-PostgreSQL migration with an unrelated feature
  upgrade unless the maintenance plan explicitly approves it

For SQLite-to-PostgreSQL migration, use
[`reference/sqlite-to-postgres-migration.md`](reference/sqlite-to-postgres-migration.md).

## Rollback

Rollback should restore the exact previous artifact and config set.

For systemd binary deployments:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop anix-control.service
sudo cp -a /opt/anixops/control/backups/anix-control.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS /opt/anixops/control/bin/anix-control
sudo rm -rf /opt/anixops/control/web/public
sudo cp -a /opt/anixops/control/backups/public.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS /opt/anixops/control/web/public
sudo cp -a /opt/anixops/control/backups/config.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.yaml /opt/anixops/control/config/config.yaml
sudo systemctl start anix-control.service
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
```

For Docker Compose deployments:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
# restore the previously approved image tag, env file, and mounted config
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
```

If the upgrade changed database state, restore the database backup only when the
approved rollback plan says so. Keep the failed-upgrade logs and the final
database driver/config in the maintenance record.

## Post-Upgrade Record

After a successful upgrade, record:

- target tag and commit
- artifact checksum verification output
- service restart time
- `/health` output
- core admin/user/node smoke results
- database migration evidence, if any
- rollback artifacts retained and retention period

Do not delete backups until the rollback window has expired.
